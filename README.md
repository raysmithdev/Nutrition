Project Requirements:

The guidelines listed below were provided by the project markdown:

User of MongoDB and Express to create data CRUD
Produce a RESTful API that expresses at least one model
Consume its own API using AJAX
Authenticate users using at least one OAuth provider
Restrict access to the Creation, Updating, and Deletion of resources using an authorization middleware function
Be deployed online using Heroku

Necessary Deliverables:

A working app, built by me, hosted somewhere on the Internet
A client application that consumes our own API, hosted somewhere on the internet
A link to our hosted, working app in the URL section of our Github repo
A Git repository hosted on Github, with frequent commits from every team member dating back to the very beginning of the project

MVP

A working login page that includes both local and OAuth login options
A working create account feature that allows users to create a NutriKing account
The ability for users to create, edit, and delete a profile
The ability for users to create, edit and delete meals
The ability for users to be able to view logs from previous meals added

Approach taken

I started by drawing out our Wireframes via Balsamiq to a diagram and to plan our project.
After that, I made a planning board and wrote user stories using Asana.
I created models, views, and controllers for our app. I achieved full CRUD using RESTful routing.
Lastly, after all the debugging, I deployed the project to Heroku.

Future Implementations

The ability to create a meal plan for weight loss
The ability to have autocomplete function for the search bar
The ability for users being able to upload a before and after picture
The ability to have the meal history of the user to be displayed in a calendar
